Javascript calculator using HTML, CSS, Javascirpt
I have did it with the help of Hary Bhai known as CodeWithHarry on youtube. I have updated the design and try to make it according to Numerical2 iOS calculator app.
Feel free to fix the issue if you will face any.
Always welcomes for your suggestions.

Thanks
